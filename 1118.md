## Let's Get It Start !
### MMEM 
*    A linear relationship model for on Logistic Regression.
*    The weight of Logistic Reg. is $\theta_k$
*    Do a normalization at each step of time t 
*    Dependent on each t state
### CRF
*    Key difference : Normalization term 
*    Do a normalization for a whole sequence of t 
*    Only dependent on X not on t

### comparison of MEMM and CRF
* MMEM only depends on each individual state
* CRF uses the whole sequences
* Generally, CRF is greater than MMEM

## Feature Engineering for MMEN/CRF
* Like bigram, trigram, Capital Initial, Punct, Begin, end, and Shape(Xx, xxx)

>   We use LBFGS to optim our parameters rather than Gradient Boosting.

## Information Extration and Named Entity Recognization

### Information Extration
* turns the unstructured information extraction information embedded in texts into structured data

### NER
* the joint task of coreference (代詞) resolution and entity linking
* To identify name in text
* Name can be linked and indexed
* find each mention of a named entity in the text and label its type
* Event coreference : is needed to figure out which event mentions in a text refer to the same event

### Features for NER
* With the aid of word shape can group similar types of target 
* 老師有講跟沒講一樣 怎麼做期末報告
* Let me show you how to make it real 
* you should read the paper of NER and present to us
* Teach him how to pronounce 章魚 :octopus: 
* for you : https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01360

### Chinese Segmentation
* Make a boundary for word segmentation 
* Design of the tag 
    * BIO / BME / LMRS(Best for Chinese) focus on the last character word 
* Use the white space to separate word then translating into LMRS form

### Linguistic Features
* Radical : 部首
* Character Type in py : unicode data
* Dictionary Features：
    * dictionary M -> whether it can be used as middle Chinese word or not, which can be features for Chinese word segmentation 
* Use Chinese word segmentation to know the boundary of character
