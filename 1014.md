## Performance Evaluation & Wrod Sence Disambuguation
### Held Out Data
* training data
* validation data
* test data

### Time dependent data train splitting training and testing with time variable
### Cross-Validation 
* k-fold : Split data into k parts and every part will be used to train and test once time
    * Shortage : Time consuming 
    * $\frac{1}{k}$ will be used to test data
    * Set k as 5 in common
* Leave-One-Out
    * k equals to n
### Performance Metrics
* Accuracy
    * A bad model may get a high accuracy in some cases 
    * Problem of Data Imbalance
* Recall : $\frac{tp}{tp+fn}$
* Precision : $\frac{tp}{tp+fp}$
* F-score : Harmonic average of Recall and Precision : $\frac{2*Precision*Recall}{Precision+Recall}$
* Error Rate = (1 - accuracy)
* Sensitivity : How many positive cases can be confirmed = Recall
* Specificity : How many negative cases can be confirmed = Recall of negative cases 
* Macro-Averaging vs. Micro Averaging 
    * Micro averaging will be close to Accuracy 
    * Neglect the size of category then taking Macro averaging 
### How to confirm the performance difference 
* With the help of statistical significance tests
* McNemar's Test:
   *  two models have the same error rate
   * Null Hypothesis is $n_{01}$ = $n_{10}$
    * Can't be used to compare reported accuracy

# Word  Sense Disambiguation
 ### Many words have several meanings or senses
 * WordNet Search to find meanings of word
 * Also use Python to search by NLTK
     * Consider the "Particular use" and "Context" to determine which of the senses of word 
* Determin infinited set of the sences Sw of w
  * w is the target 
  * s' = arg max P(s|w,C)
  * C is the contexual information of w
### Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
#### Supervised ML
* Bayes' Theorem : P(x|y) is difficult to calculate, so use Naive assumption
* Naive assumption : Assumption of all features will be independent each other

#### Unsupervised ML
* Lesk Algorithm
    * Draw back : Sensitive to the exact wording of definitions 
* NLP focus on unsupervised model due to the lack of labeled data 
* SemEval: Semantic Evaluation 
    * Used to detect meaning of words
